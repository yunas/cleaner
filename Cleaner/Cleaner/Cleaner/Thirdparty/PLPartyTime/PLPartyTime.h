/**
 This is a light wrapper around the MultiPeer connectivity framework which quickly connects devices without having to send or receive invites. Here's the quick setup:

 Each device calls:
 
    PLPartyTime *partyTime = [[PLPartyTime alloc] initWithServiceType@"MyApp"];
    partyTime.delegate = self;
    [partyTime joinParty];

 Each device will get a callback when anyone connects or disconnects. Note that any device which joins the party with this service type will automatically join without sending or receiving invitations.

    - (void)partyTime:(PLPartyTime *)partyTime peer:(MCPeerID *)peer changedState:(MCSessionState)state currentPeers:(NSArray *)currentPeers;
 
 Then, anytime you want to send data, you can call a method to send to all connected users (peers) or an array of select peers.

    - (BOOL)sendData:(NSData *)data withMode:(MCSessionSendDataMode)mode error:(NSError **)error;
    - (BOOL)sendData:(NSData *)data toPeers:(NSArray *)peerIDs withMode:(MCSessionSendDataMode)mode error:(NSError **)error;

 The clients receiving data get the callback:

    - (void)partyTime:(PLPartyTime *)partyTime didReceiveData:(NSData *)data fromPeer:(MCPeerID *)peerID;

 And that's it.
 There are a few more features of this library, but I'll let you read through the documentation to find those specifically.

 1. Must be 1–15 characters long.
 2. Can contain only ASCII lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.
 
 This name should be easily distinguished from unrelated services. For example, a text chat app made by ABC company could use the service type abc-txtchat. For more details, read “Domain Naming Conventions”.
